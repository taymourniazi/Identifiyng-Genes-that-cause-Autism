Additionally, six of seven autistic male siblings of probands in male-male multiplex families had the deletion, suggesting that TMLHE deficiency is a risk factor for autism (meta-analysis Z-score = 2.90 and P = 0.0037), although with low penetrance (2-4%). These data suggest that dysregulation of carnitine metabolism may be important in nondysmorphic autism; that abnormalities of carnitine intake, loss, transport, or synthesis may be important in a larger fraction of nondysmorphic autism cases; and that the carnitine pathway may provide a novel target for therapy or prevention of autism.  More recently, a nonsense variant in TMLHE was identified in two brothers with autism and ID, but not in other healthy male family members (PMID 23092983); two missense variants in this gene were also identified in male ASD cases from simplex families in this report.","21865298, 22566635, 23092983",Sfari

TSPAN7,tetraspanin 7,4.4,4,"111 X-linked synaptic genes were sequenced in 140 ASD subjects (Piton et al., 2011). A P172H missense variant, which was associated earlier with mental retardation (MR) in two families, was identified. In the first MR study, the cosegregation of this variant with MR was not perfect, with one non-affected male carrying the variant. This variant was also identified by another team who screened patients with MR; it was absent in 77 ASD patients and 420 control chromosomes tested. The P172H variant (maternally inherited) was observed in one boy with ASD and MR in Piton et al. (2011). That study also utilized 190 controls and an additional 285 ASD subjects for replication by sequencing only the region containing this variant amino acid. In doing so, they found the same variant in another boy diagnosed with pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified without MR. This specific variant was neither present in 143 schizophrenia subjects nor in 190 ethnically matched control individuals. Taken together, these reports revealed that the P172H variant has not been found in 697 control X chromosomes (excluding relatives of the affected subjects).  Marshall et al.
