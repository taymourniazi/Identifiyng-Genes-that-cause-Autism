# Identifiyng-Genes-that-cause-Autism
## Discovering Genes that cause Autism using Network Theory


### Protein-Protein Interaction Network

BioGRID dataset can be found here (http://thebiogrid.org)


###  Genes Causing Autism

Dataset provided by SFARI Gene (https://gene.sfari.org/autdb/Welcome.do )

Sample file --- “gene-id-table.txt”

###  Building an Autism Interactome

The source script used in it is named as “steiner_tree.R”

### Analysis and Properties of the Autism Interactome

Analyze the properties of the Autism Interactome and compare it to randomly generated
Interactomes

### Identifying New Candidate Genes

Identifying New Candidate Genes that could cus Autism with using betweenness centrality measure
